# Enhancing-Encryption-Algorithms-to-design-Secure-Data-Transmission-Chatrooms

Encryption Algorithms are a necessary part of data sharing today as every bit of data need encryption so that it could be transferred from one place to another without the fear of data leaking. Every lost bit of data puts the system, organization in danger. The algorithms are analysed for ways to break it down to remove all the data dependencies and inter-dependent steps that can be resolved. Encryption algorithms compose of necessary steps involving a key that helps convert plain text to cipher text. All the steps must be performed carefully to ensure that the data encrypted is found back.
